# RMP Comunity Calendar

Duration: 2 weeks.
We had the opportunity to collaborate with Richland Music Parents, who maintain a community calendar featuring events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and memorial commemorations. This calendar is shared with the entire community. The challenge they faced was an outdated order process that relied on paper forms. To address this issue, we digitized the ordering process and implemented several innovative features to enhance the experience for both customers and the client. RMP Community Calendar is a web application that enables users to order calendars and manage event listings, catering to two types of users: regular users and administrators. Regular users have the ability to order a calendar, add events to it, and purchase additional events as needed. Meanwhile, administrators can oversee all user orders and events, promote regular users to admin status, and create orders on behalf of individuals who may lack technical proficiency or internet access.
